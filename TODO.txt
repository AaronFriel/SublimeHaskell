TODO
====

* Implement smarter auto-complete, based on module export lists
* Underline errors in red
* Add "go to definition" (alt-click)
* Show function type/docs (in status bar?)
* Add "find all references"
* Add HLint support
* Add a syntax definition for the error panel format, so that error messages are highlighted

Syntax problems
---------------
* Most of the types in type signatures (except the first one) are incorrectly classified as "storage.type" -- should be something like "user-defined class"
* "Just" and "Nothing" are classified as "support.constant" -- should probably be either "support.type" or "support class"
